## Transforming Informal Learning into Verifiable Proof

Credence is a platform that bridges the gap between informal learning and verifiable credentials. We enable users to earn XP for watching educational YouTube videos and receive soulbound NFTs as proof of mastery, creating a verifiable credential layer for informal learning.

## 🧠 The Problem

Millions of people are self-taught through platforms like YouTube, Substack, and blogs — but they have no credible way to prove what they've learned. Employers and institutions still rely on degrees or formal certificates, leaving informal learners with a skills gap that's invisible on paper.

> "Today, learning happens everywhere. But proof doesn't. We're changing that."

## 🛠️ The Solution

Credence transforms informal learning into verifiable proof through:

- **XP tracking** for educational content consumption
- **AI-generated quizzes** that test comprehension, not just completion
- **Soulbound NFTs** that serve as on-chain credentials
- **Topic categorization** that builds toward knowledge domains

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **User pastes a YouTube link** on the web app (educational videos only)
2. User logs in (email or wallet-based)
3. **XP is awarded** when the video is watched
4. **AI-generated quiz** (from transcript) appears for optional extra XP
5. Once enough XP is earned in a topic (e.g., Web3, Data Science), user can **claim a soulbound NFT** that lives in their wallet as proof of mastery
6. Over time, users build a **learning profile** with on-chain credentials tied to specific knowledge areas

## ✨ Features

- Modern UI with cyberpunk/tech aesthetic
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Video embedding functionality
- Skills tracking with XP accumulation
- AI-powered quiz generation from video transcripts
- Soulbound NFT credential issuance on Solana
- Interactive elements with custom hover effects

## 🧪 Validation

We've already tested this model with 80+ students in our club, using a modified version of Zealy to track learning progress. This real-world validation confirms both the need and the effectiveness of our approach.

## 👥 Team

- **Ezven** - Started the club that helped 100+ students learn Web3 and crypto
- **Shreyas Prabhakar** - CS student who built a similar Proof Of Knowledge-based project
- **Wyatt** - Manages the XP system in our club, self-taught in Web3 and Sui development

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- Browser extension for seamless XP claiming
- Expansion beyond YouTube to other learning platforms
- AI content evaluation system to rate educational resources
- Alternate methods to prove comprehension
- Employer verification portal for credential validation
- Freemium model with premium tools and employer-side verification

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: CSS with custom animations
- **Blockchain**: Solana for soulbound NFT credentials
- **AI**: Natural Language Processing for quiz generation and content categorization
